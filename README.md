# OpenCombinedExportFile
This code opens the combined export file and prints only the sleep data without the headers. Then, it saves the new data table as a csv. 
#CombinedExportFilePandas
Basically the same as the OpenCombinedExportFile, but this one uses pandas and prints only the sleep data with headers. 
# OpenWatchFilePandas
The code opens the raw data from the watch export files and concatenates them together in one big file. Subject numbers are preserved.
#NewWatchFile
Opens the csv files by subject and concatenates all the files of one subject together. Currently does not succeed in opening the csv file.
