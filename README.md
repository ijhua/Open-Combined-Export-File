# OpenCombinedExportFile
This code opens the combined export file and prints only the sleep data without the headers. Then, it saves the new data table as a csv. 
#CombinedExportFilePandas
Basically the same as the OpenCombinedExportFile, but this one uses pandas and prints only the sleep data with headers. 
# OpenWatchFilePandas
Still in progress. The code will open only the raw data from the watch export files.
